## OpenEscrow - Build trust. Unlock opportunity.


### A Housing Blockchain Solution for Social Good

**OpenEscrow** is a free, open-source blockchain application that transforms rental security deposit management by replacing costly, opaque third-party intermediaries with transparent, trust-minimized smart contracts.  

Built as a digital public good ‚Äî not for profit ‚Äî OpenEscrow promotes financial inclusion, housing stability, and real-world trust without centralized control.

There is no company, licensing fee, or monetization model behind OpenEscrow ‚Äî it is public infrastructure for tenants, landlords, developers, and governments to freely use and build upon.

### Project Overview

OpenEscrow provides:
- Smart contract-based escrow management for rental deposits
- Transparent deposit release, dispute workflows, and invoice tracking
- Optional yield generation through tokenized U.S. Treasuries
- One-click reporting and automated notification system
- Opt-in reputation and review mechanism
- Multilingual and globally accessible deployment
- Future-dated refunds
- Fiat onramps (planned) via services like Moonpay or NowPayments
- Wallet abstraction (planned) for email/social media login support

### Why OpenEscrow Matters

Security deposit handling is a major global pain point:
- 25% of tenants report disputes with landlords over deposits
- Lack of transparency and legal fees cause housing insecurity
- Small claims courts are flooded with deposit dispute cases
- Many jurisdictions impose triple damages for improper withholding

By leveraging blockchain:
- OpenEscrow creates **transparent and trust-minimized** processes
- Reduces legal costs and landlord/tenant disputes
- Supports affordable housing programs with better financial controls
- Demonstrates how blockchain can serve real-world needs, not speculation
