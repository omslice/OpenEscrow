### A Housing Blockchain Solution for Social Good

**OpenEscrow** is a free, open-source blockchain application that transforms rental security deposit management by replacing costly, opaque third-party intermediaries with transparent, trust-minimized smart contracts.  

Built as a digital public good — not for profit — OpenEscrow promotes financial inclusion, housing stability, and real-world trust without centralized control.

There is no company, licensing fee, or monetization model behind OpenEscrow — it is public infrastructure for tenants, landlords, developers, and governments to freely use and build upon.

### Project Overview

OpenEscrow provides:
- Smart contract-based escrow management for rental deposits
- Transparent deposit release, dispute workflows, and invoice tracking
- Optional yield generation through tokenized U.S. Treasuries
- One-click reporting and automated notification system
- Opt-in reputation and review mechanism
- Multilingual and globally accessible deployment
- Future-dated refunds
- Fiat onramps (planned) via services like Moonpay or NowPayments
- Wallet abstraction (planned) for email/social media login support

### Why OpenEscrow Matters

OpenEscrow also aligns with key priorities for public goods and the public sector in general:
- Promoting financial inclusion for underserved communities
- Supporting tenant and landlord trust and protections
- Reducing cost and complexity in housing dispute resolution
- Providing transparent, trust-minimized security deposit management

There is no company, profit model, or licensing fee behind OpenEscrow. It is a digital public good - free infrastructure for communities, governments, and NGOs to adotp, build on, or deploy as needed.

Security deposit handling is a major global pain point:
- 25%+ of tenants report disputes with landlords over deposits
- Lack of transparency and legal fees cause housing insecurity
- Small claims courts are flooded with deposit dispute cases
- Many jurisdictions impose triple damages for improper withholding

By leveraging blockchain:
- OpenEscrow creates **transparent and trust-minimized** management
- Reduces legal costs and landlord/tenant disputes
- Supports affordable housing programs with better financial controls
- Demonstrates how blockchain can serve real-world needs, not speculation
