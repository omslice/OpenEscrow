### A Housing Blockchain Solution for Social Good

**OpenEscrow** is a free, open source app for transparent and fair management of the rental security deposit, that builds trust and unlocks financial opportunity between tenants and landlords by using smart contracts to serve as a neutral 3rd party escrow agent. 

Built as a digital public good â€” not for profit â€” OpenEscrow promotes financial inclusion, housing stability, and real-world trust without centralized control.

There is no company, licensing fee, or monetization model behind OpenEscrow â€” it is public infrastructure for tenants, landlords, developers, and governments to freely use and build upon.

### Project Overview

OpenEscrow provides:
- Smart contract-based escrow management for rental deposits
- Invoice upload requirement for each deduction
- Automated on-chain notifications
- Tenant dispute/approval mechanics
- Optional yield generation through U.S. Treasury-backed stablecoins
- One-click report generation
- Opt-in reputation system
- Future-dated refunds
- Web2 iterface, no wallet, transaction interaction (unless desired)
- Fiat on/off ramps via services like Moonpay or NowPayments
- Wallet abstraction for email/social media login support
- Multilingual and globally accessible deployment
- Can be deployed on any chain without need for cross-chain functionality
- Future plans to support other types of escrow arrangements

### Why OpenEscrow Matters

OpenEscrow also aligns with key priorities for public goods and the public sector in general:
- Promoting financial inclusion for underserved communities
- Supporting tenant and landlord trust and protections
- Reducing cost and complexity in housing dispute resolution
- Providing transparent, trust-minimized security deposit management

There is no company, profit model, or licensing fee behind OpenEscrow. It is a digital public good - free infrastructure for communities, governments, and NGOs to adopt, build on top of, or deploy as needed.

Security deposit handling is a major global pain point:
- 25%+ of tenants report disputes with landlords over deposits
- Lack of transparency and legal fees cause housing insecurity
- Small claims courts are flooded with deposit dispute cases
- Many jurisdictions impose triple damages for improper withholding

These issues are generally due to:
- Lack of transparency or controls in deductions
- No standardized documentation

By leveraging blockchain:
- OpenEscrow creates **transparent and trust-minimized** management
- Reduces legal costs and landlord/tenant disputes
- Supports affordable housing programs with better financial controls
- Demonstrates how blockchain can serve real-world needs, not speculation
