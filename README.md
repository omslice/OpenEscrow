### A Housing Blockchain Solution for Social Good

**OpenEscrow** is a free, open source app for transparent and fair management of the rental security deposit, that builds trust and unlocks financial opportunity between tenants and landlords by using smart contracts to serve as a neutral 3rd party escrow agent.

Built as a digital public good ‚Äî not for profit ‚Äî OpenEscrow promotes financial inclusion, housing stability, and real-world trust without centralized control.

There is no company, licensing fee, or monetization model behind OpenEscrow ‚Äî it is public infrastructure for tenants, landlords, developers, and governments to freely use and build upon.

---

## System Wireframe

This flow illustrates the full life cycle of a rental deposit agreement through OpenEscrow. It reflects a more transparent and tenant-centric logic, where the deposit is considered the tenant's property by default. A notice period is required before any release process can begin, and the landlord must submit a claim that is externally validated to override the default refund. The flow also includes optional integration with a yield module (for on-chain interest) and a read-only viewer contract to power the UI.

> üí° **Token Choice Note:**  
> WYST is the default payment token, but users may also choose supported stablecoins such as USDC or USDY. As long as sufficient liquidity exists on DEXs or CEXs, no dedicated pool is required. Users without a balance in their selected token will be prompted to swap before depositing.

### Why OpenEscrow Matters

OpenEscrow redefines how rental deposits are handled by aligning with the reality that **the deposit legally belongs to the tenant** until a valid claim proves otherwise.

This updated model:

* Promotes financial inclusion for underserved communities
* Prevents abuse of power by landlords
* Aligns with small claims court principles: burden of proof is on the claimant (landlord)
* Reduces stress and legal cost for tenants
* Provides programmable transparency through `rulesModule`
* Makes claims auditable, reproducible, and automated

Traditional models transfer the deposit unless the tenant proves otherwise. OpenEscrow **inverts that logic** to reflect real-world fairness: if there is no valid claim, **the tenant keeps the deposit**.

### Technical Stack

- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- IPFS (Decentralized invoice/document storage)
- Chainlink (DeFi data oracles)
- React (Frontend web development)
- Web3Auth (planned wallet abstraction)
- Optional fiat onramp integration (e.g., Moonpay, NowPayments)

---

### How to Test Locally

1. **Install Foundry (if not already)**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup

2. **Clone the repo and install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd OpenEscrow

3. **Run all testsl**
   ```bash
   forge test

4. **Run a single test suite**
   ```bash
   forge test --match-contract RefundWithYieldTest

5. **See gas usage**
   ```bash
   forge test --gas-report

**All core flows (refund, release, yield, factory, viewer) are fully tested and should pass [PASS].**

---

### Features Covered / TODO / Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Features Covered

- Modular escrow contract with pluggable modules (rules, yield)
- Refund and release flows with tested yield split (tenant/landlord)
- Factory for multi-user/multi-vault management
- EscrowViewer for off-chain dashboard/analytics
- Core error handling and revert tests

### üü° TODO / Roadmap

- EIP-712 signature-based interactions (walletless UX)
- Factory advanced (clones, multi-chain, mapping)
- EscrowViewer: batch reads, indexer, pagination
- UI: Minimal testnet demo / Remix playground
